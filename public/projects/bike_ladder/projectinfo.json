    "description": "A sculptural bike ladder made from old bikes welded together.",

    "details": "This was my final project for ATP-240: Intro to Sculpture at Northwestern University. I found several old abandoned bikes, stripped them of their parts, and TIG welded them together to create a ladder. The project involved cutting parts from different bikes and welding them together in a stable structure that could support weight. The bike ladder was installed freestanding on campus for a few months.",
