    "description": "Designed and manufactured a multi-part injection molded toy featuring an axolotl riding a boat, created for a manufacturing processes course.",

    "details": "This project was completed as part of a manufacturing course focused on injection molding. Our team of three designed and produced an axolotl riding a boat toy using injection molding techniques. I was responsible for designing the boat component, creating the mold design for the boat, and machining the boat molds. My teammates handled the axolotl design and fabrication. The project involved CAD design, mold design considerations such as draft angles and parting lines, CNC machining of the mold cavities, and the injection molding process itself to create the final plastic parts.",
