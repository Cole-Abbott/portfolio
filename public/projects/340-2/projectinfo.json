    "description": "Designed and manufactured a multi-part injection molded toy featuring an axolotl riding a boat, created for ME 340-2 manufacturing processes course.",
    "details": "Completed for ME 340-2 at Northwestern University, our team of three designed and produced an axolotl riding a boat toy using injection molding techniques. I was responsible for designing the boat component in NX CAD, creating the complete mold design (core and cavity), programming the CNC toolpaths in NX CAM, machining the boat molds on Haas CNC machines, and performing manual machining operations. The boat was designed with uniform wall thickness, draft angles, and interference fit assembly. The mold required a split design due to deep slot machining constraints. Injection molding parameters were optimized through iterative testing with polypropylene at 450°C.",
