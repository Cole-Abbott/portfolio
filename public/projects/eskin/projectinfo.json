    "description": "Firmware development for an electronic skin (E-Skin) sensor system designed for robotic tactile sensing applications. The project involves high-speed analog-to-digital conversion and real-time USB data transmission for a 64-electrode sensor array.",
    "details": "Developed firmware for a PIC32 MZ EF microcontroller using MPLAB Harmony framework. Implemented custom ADC driver for sampling 64 tactile sensor electrodes at high speeds, with USB bulk transfer for real-time data streaming to a host computer. The system features interrupt-driven DMA transfers, configurable sampling rates, and Python-based data acquisition interface.",
