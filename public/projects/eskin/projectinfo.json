    "description": "Developed firmware for a robotic electronic skin sensor system using PIC32 microcontrollers and MPLAB Harmony framework for tactile sensing applications in robotics research.",

    "details": "This research project involved developing firmware for an electronic skin (e-skin) sensor system designed for robotic tactile sensing applications. The system uses PIC32 microcontrollers running MPLAB Harmony framework to interface with arrays of tactile sensors, process sensor data in real-time, and communicate with higher-level control systems.",
