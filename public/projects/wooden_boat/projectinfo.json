    "description": "A wooden boat sculpture with metal sails, created as a final project for an art class.",

    "details": "This was my final project for ATP-390: The useless / useful object at Northwestern University. I chose to make a boat sculpture with a carved wooden hull and metal sails. The hull was carved from a solid block of wood with a drawknife and spokeshave, then sanded and finished with wax. The sails were made from sheet metal, cut and rolled and fixed to the wooden mast.",
