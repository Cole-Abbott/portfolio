    "description": "Designed differential housing for a Baja SAE off-road vehicle using SolidWorks and manufactured using CNC machining.",
    "details": "The project involved creating a detailed CAD model of the differential housing, and manufacturing 3 of them, a front, rear and spare. Once the design was compleate NX CAM was used to program the CNC machine. The housing had 3 main parts, each of which had multilple operations to machine, including precise bearing fits. The final design met all performance criteria and was successfully manufactured and performed well at competition.",
