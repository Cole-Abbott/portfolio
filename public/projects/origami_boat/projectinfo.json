    "details": "For this project, I wanted to take a typcal origami boat, and recreate it out of metal. I designed the boat in CAD software, then cut out the peices from steel plate. I then TIG welded the peices together to create the final sculpture. The boat was then ground down and finished with a cold blue to darken the metal.",
